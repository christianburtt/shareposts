# shareposts

## About
SharePosts is a **very** simple social media platform built on the "basicMVC" framework, a slight variation of the TraversyMVC by Brad Traversy through a udemy class.

It is nothing special, just a chance to build an MVC framework and a simple app on top of it. I don't think I'll be using this in place of CodeIgniter or Laravel anytimesoon, but the practice to build it out is helpful

## Installation
### SQL DB
Run the SQL script to create a DB. Ensure you create a user and pw and grant permissions

### PHP Framework
Simply copy the files to the public html folder on your web server
 - Update DB and URLROOT info in app/config/config.php
 - Update the .htaccess file in public/.htaccess to point to the same folder as URLROOT
 
 That's it!
